                <h3>STORY US</h3>
                <p>Ariana Join founded Kay xau mini in 2012. Passionate about plants, she wanted to help demystify them, make them accessible to non-gardeners, and enhance the experience beyond micro local garden supply center. She broke new ground with an online plant delivery business that has grown to include stores in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Hands-on educational workshops are now offered in-store and online, and the brand vision has expanded beyond plants to include biophilic design that evokes an essential connection to the natural world . If you don't make time for them, you probably don't make time for yourself either.
